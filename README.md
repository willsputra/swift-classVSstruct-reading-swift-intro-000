## Overview

This quiz will give you practice working with both classes and structs. 

## Quiz Time!

In the last few lessons, you've learned a lot about classes and structs in Swift. Now, challenge yourself with a brief quiz to test everything you've learned.

### Question 1

Given this class that represents a giant:

```swift
class Giant {
    var name: String
    var weight: Double
    let homePlanet: String

    init(name: String, weight: Double, homePlanet: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.weight = weight
        self.homePlanet = homePlanet
    }
}
```

And this code that instantiates an instance of `Giant`:

```swift
let fred = Giant(name: "Fred", weight: 340.0, homePlanet: "Earth")
```

Will these three lines of code run? If not, why not?

```swift
fred.name = "Brick"
fred.weight = 999.2
fred.homePlanet = "Mars"
```

---> NO, BECAUSE HOME PLANET IS A LET

### Question 2

Can you fix the class definition above so that it _does_ work?

---> var homePlanet: String

### Question 3

Take a look at this struct that represents an alien:

```swift
struct Alien {
    var name: String
    var height: Double
    var homePlanet: String
}
```

And this line of code that instantiates an `Alien`:

```swift
let bilbo = Alien(name: "Bilbo", height: 1.67, homePlanet: "Venus")
```

Will these three lines of code run? If so, why not?

```swift
bilbo.name = "Jake"
bilbo.height = 1.42
bilbo.homePlanet = "Saturn"
```

---> NO, BECAUSE let bilbo

### Question 4

Can you change the declaration of `bilbo` so that the above three lines of code _do_ work?

---> var bilbo...

### Question 5

Consider this bit of code that uses the `Giant` class:

```swift
let edgar = Giant(name: "Edgar", weight: 520.0, homePlanet: "Earth")
let jason = edgar
jason.name = "Jason"
```

What will the value of `edgar.name` be after those three lines of code are run? What will the value of `jason.name` be? Why?

---> Jason, Jason

### Question 6

Given this bit of code that uses the `Alien` struct:

```swift
var charles = Alien(name: "Charles", height: 2.25, homePlanet: "Pluto")
var charlesFromJupiter = charles
charlesFromJupiter.homePlanet = "Jupiter"
```

What will the value of `charles.homePlanet` be after the above code run? What about the value of `charlesFromJupiter.homePlanet`? Why?

---> Pluto, Jupiter

### Question 7

Here's a struct that represents a bank account:

```swift
struct BankAccount {
    var owner: String
    var balance: Double

    func deposit(_ amount: Double) {
        balance += amount
    }

    func withdraw(_ amount: Double) {
        balance -= amount
    }
}
```

Does this code work? Why or why not?

---> NOPE, IMMUTABLE

### Question 8

Can you fix the `BankAccount` struct so it _does_ work?

---> mutating func

### Question 9

Given this bit of code (which incorporates any fixes you made in Question 8):

```swift
var joeAccount = BankAccount(owner: "Joe", balance: 100.0)
var joeOtherAccount = joeAccount
joeAccount.withdraw(50.0)
```

What will the value of `joeAccount.balance` be after the above code runs? What about the value of `joeOtherAccount.balance`? Why?

---> joeAccount= 50, joeOtherAccount = 100. BECAUSE A COPY IS CREATED

### Question 10

Here's a class that can track songs in a music library:

```swift
class MusicLibrary {
    var tracks: [String]

    init() {
        tracks = []
    }

    func add(track: String) {
        tracks.append(track)
    }
}
```

Given this bit of code that uses `MusicLibrary`:

```swift
let library1 = MusicLibrary()
library1.add(track: "Michelle")
library1.add(track: "Voodoo Child")
let library2 = library1
library2.add(track: "Come As You Are")
```

After this code runs, what are the contents of `library1.tracks`? What about the contents of `library2.tracks`? Why?

---> SAME, ("MICHELLE", "VOODOO CHILD", "COME AS YOU ARE") -> COS REFERENCE TYPE
